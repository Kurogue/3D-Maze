# Project 3

The way that I have implemented the project is with a DFS algorithm using an adjacency list. The boost libraries were not used in the implementation of the project. A makefile is included so the code can be compiled that way. If the makefile does not work the code can be compiled and run with the command below. Once the executable is created the program can be run with the command `./maze`.

### Compile and Run Commands

Without makefile
```
g++ -std=c++11 -o maze project3.cpp
./maze
```

With makefile
```
./maze
```
